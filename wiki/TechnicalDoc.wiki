#summary Various Technical aspects of building YMFAS

= Introduction =

This is the technical spec for YMFAS. It includes information about overall engine design, externally libraries used, etc.

= Platform / Requirements =
YMFAS is aimed at Windows 2000 or higher. It will require DirectX 9, along with other 

= Language =
The game/engine will be written in C# on top of the .NET platform, with the possible (though slight) exception of using a scripting language (most likely Lua). The possibility of porting the project to Mono is slim, since the project uses some non-portable libraries (see Graphics, Input)

= Graphics =
== External Libraries ==
We currently plan on using the Ogre3D Rendering Engine (v 1.4.0) and the MOGRE port to C#. 

== Features ==
More specific features will be listed in time.

= Input =
== External Libraries ==
YMFAS will only need DirectInput 9. 

== Features ==
YMFAS requires a mouse and keyboard. Joystick point is currently not planned. If joystick support becomes necessary, we will consider using XInput as well.

= Networking =
== External Libraries ==
YMFAS uses the [http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-library-network/ Lidgren] networking library.

== Features ==
YMFAS will use a fairly standard server-client architecture for multiplayer games. Matches can support up to 16* players.

= Physics =
== External Libraries ==
YMFAS will make use of the [http://www.newtondynamics.com/ Newton Game Dynamics] library,  through MogreNewt, a port of OgreNewt, an interface layer between Ogre3D and Newton.
